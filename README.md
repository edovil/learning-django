# learning-django

Repo just for play and learn django. It's public for anyone who find this repo useful.

The documentation of Django proyect is [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/)

# Install & Configuration

## Virtual Environment

In this version, we use `virtualenv` (and the virtual environment is not in the repo, so you have to set up that). Run these commands in first place:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project

virtualenv -p python3 .

source bin/activate

pip install Django==4.0.2
```
Here, you can use the lastest stable version at February 2022. Otherwise, specify by `pip install django==X.X.X`.

That's it for now. Enjoy learning! :grin:
